#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- Display organized product grid showing 4 items per page with product images, names, prices, and **Add to Bag** buttons - each card provides essential product information for purchasing. Header shows product count and sorting options while promotional banner presents current offers.
- Enable cart management through side panel showing selected items with images, details, and quantity controls - each item includes +/- buttons and remove option. Cart updates totals automatically while maintaining an accurate item count badge for tracking purchases.
- Implement instant search filtering where users can filter products by name or category - each search input updates the product display immediately while the sort dropdown enables price-based arrangement. Filtering resets pagination and updates the product count to reflect current results.
- Create pagination system showing 4 products per page with navigation controls - each page transition preserves active filters and sort preferences. Current page indicates active state and boundary buttons disable when reaching limits.
- Show toast notifications for user actions in the bottom-right corner - each message appears for adding items, removing items, or checkout attempts. Notifications provide clear feedback for user interactions.
- Process checkout flows by validating cart state before completion - each attempt verifies current cart contents and displays appropriate messages. Empty cart prevents checkout and suggests continuing shopping.
- Implement quick search functionality with instant results - each keystroke filters products by name and category matches. Search interface provides immediate feedback and maintains the current sort order.
- Configure sorting system with price-based options - each sort selection reorders products while maintaining current search filters. Sort controls allow arranging items by ascending or descending price.
- Establish count tracking for cart and filtered results - each update to cart or search refreshes relevant counts automatically. Count displays show the current number of items and search results accurately.
- Ensure clicking on the delete button icon removes the product item from the cart - each deletion updates the cart totals, item count badge, and cart content.
- Ensure total price dynamically increments or decrements based on cart operations - each addition, removal, or quantity change reflects in the total price and subtotal calculations.
