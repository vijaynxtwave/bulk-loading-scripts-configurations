#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Pomodoro timer application.
- Implement a timer that alternates between focus sessions (25 minutes) and short breaks (5 minutes).
- Provide a long break (15 minutes) after every four focus sessions.
- Offer buttons to start, reset, and skip the current session.
- Display the current session type and remaining time.
- Allow users to add and delete targets (up to a maximum of five).
- Use a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the application.


#### Recommended Libraries/Packages

- **tkinter:** For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
- **time:** For handling time-related operations, such as formatting time and creating delays.
- **random:** Not required in this specific implementation, but could be used to add random features in the future.
These libraries provide the necessary tools to implement the functionalities. Feel free to explore and integrate other relevant libraries to enhance or customize the application as needed.
