#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Tic Tac Toe game.
- Allow two players to play the game, with the option to restart the game.
- Implement game logic to determine the winner or a draw.
- Display the current player's turn and update the game board accordingly.
- Provide a feature to track and display the game's features, such as two-player game, win detection, draw detection, restart functionality, and clear UI.
- Handle user input and update the game state accordingly.


#### Recommended Libraries/Packages

- **tkinter:** For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
- **font (from tkinter):** For customizing font styles and sizes in the application.

These libraries provide the necessary tools to implement the functionalities. Feel free to explore and integrate other relevant libraries to enhance or customize the application as needed.
