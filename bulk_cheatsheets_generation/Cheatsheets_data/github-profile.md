#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- When user enters a GitHub username and clicks search (or presses Enter), application should fetch and display that user's GitHub profile information including their avatar, name, bio, and join date
- Display user's key GitHub statistics in cards format showing total number of repositories, followers count, and total stars received across all repositories
- Show 8 most recent searches in the history section with ability to click on any previous search to instantly load that profile again
- Present user's most used programming languages (top 3) based on their repositories, indicating their technical preferences
- Display additional profile details including location, company, blog link, and Twitter handle if available (show "Not available" if information is missing)
- Show loading animation while fetching profile data and error messages for invalid usernames
- Allow users to clear their entire search history with a single click using the "Clear All" button
- Provide direct link to user's GitHub profile with a "View Profile on GitHub" button that opens in a new tab
- Show welcome message when no profile is being displayed, and smoothly transition between welcome screen and profile display when searching
- API Endpoint: https://api.github.com/users/${username}
