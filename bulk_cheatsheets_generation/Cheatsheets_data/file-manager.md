#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- Create a command-line interface (CLI) application to organize files in a directory.
- Ask the user to input a directory path.
- Check if the input path exists and is a directory.
- Get a list of files in the directory.
- Organize files into subdirectories based on their file extensions.
- Create subdirectories if they do not exist.
- Move files to their corresponding subdirectories.
- Handle errors and exceptions during the file organization process.
- Provide feedback to the user about the organization process.


#### Recommended Libraries/Packages

- **os:** For working with the operating system, including checking if a path exists and creating directories.
- **shutil:** For moving files from one location to another.
These libraries provide the necessary tools to implement the functionalities. Feel free to explore and integrate other relevant libraries to enhance or customize the application as needed.
