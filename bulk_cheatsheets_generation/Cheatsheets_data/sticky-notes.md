### Sticky Notes

In this assignment, let's build a Sticky Notes application by applying the concepts we have learned so far.

#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- Create an interactive sticky notes application with a toggle between grid and list views, where grid shows notes in a card-like layout and list shows them in a vertical arrangement
- Implement a real-time search functionality that filters notes as users type, instantly showing only notes whose content matches the search term
- Enable note creation with a variety of color options (yellow, pink, mint, blue, orange, lime), allowing users to add new notes with customizable backgrounds
- Implement drag and drop functionality allowing users to reorder notes, providing visual feedback during the drag operation and updating the notes order accordingly
- Add context menu (right-click) support for each note with options to change color (cycling through available colors), pin/unpin notes, and delete notes from the collection
- Create pinned notes functionality where pinned notes always stay at the top of the notes container, regardless of when they were created or their current position
- Include interactive note controls with pin and delete buttons that allow users to manage their notes directly through the visible interface
- Enable text input and editing within notes, allowing users to write, modify, and update note content at any time
