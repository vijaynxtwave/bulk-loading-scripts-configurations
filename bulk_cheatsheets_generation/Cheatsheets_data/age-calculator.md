#### Functionalities to be Achieved:

- When user selects their birthdate, application should display their current age broken down into years, months, and days (e.g., "25 years, 3 months, 15 days")
- Show how many days are remaining until the user's next birthday (e.g., "Your next birthday is in 127 days!")
- Display the day of the week when the user was born (e.g., "You were born on a Tuesday")
- Calculate and show total number of hours user has lived since birth (continuously updates)
- Present total minutes of user's life in real-time (updates every minute to show current count)
- Show total seconds lived with live counter (updates every second to display current count)
- Calculate total heartbeats in user's lifetime (based on average 70 beats per minute)
- Show approximate time spent sleeping in hours (based on average 8 hours of sleep per day)
